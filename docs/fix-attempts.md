# Fix attempts

One section per problem. Every attempt, and **the measurement that killed it**.

Read the section before touching the problem. Struck-through entries have been
tried; the number beside them is why they failed. Re-running one hoping for a
different answer is the specific waste this file exists to prevent.

Note explicitly when an attempt failed for a reason that has since changed,
because those are the ones worth revisiting.

## Biome distribution did not match Earth

**Problem.** The first generator produced 0.2% desert against Earth's 19% of
land, and 44.6% forest against 31%. A planet with no deserts on it.

* ~~Fit the zonal precipitation profile to observed zonal means.~~ **0.2%
  desert.** The published zonal mean at 30° is around 600 mm, and fitting to it
  gave a planet with essentially no arid land. The mistake was subtle: that
  600 mm is almost entirely *ocean*. The land sitting at 30° is the Sahara,
  Arabia, the Atacama, the Kalahari and the Australian interior. The model only
  ever evaluates precipitation over land, so the land profile is the honest
  target and the all-surface figure is the wrong one.

* ~~Refit the profile against land: raise the ITCZ peak, narrow both bands,
  drop the background from 200 mm to 70, strengthen continentality.~~ **4.1%
  desert, 44.6% forest.** Better but still nowhere near. Sweeping four
  parameters over sixteen combinations could not get desert above 8% without
  destroying the forest fraction — which is the signature of a problem that is
  not in the parameters at all.

* **Classify on the aridity index rather than on rainfall.** **Worked: total
  absolute error 0.266 → 0.068.** Absolute rainfall thresholds have no cold
  desert in them. Everything temperate and dry was becoming grassland, so the
  Gobi, the Great Basin, the Taklamakan and Patagonia — about a third of
  Earth's desert area — were all classified wrong. The UNEP aridity index is
  precipitation over potential evapotranspiration, so it asks how much water a
  place has relative to how fast it loses it. 200 mm is a desert at 25 °C and a
  wetland at 0 °C, and no single rainfall number can say that.

  Final: forest 32.0% (Earth 31), grass 27.9% (25), desert 19.3% (19),
  tundra and ice 17.4% (20).

**Still open.** Tundra and ice sit 2.6 points low. Not chased yet; it is within
the tolerance the suite asserts and the likeliest cause is that the seasonal
amplitude model is too crude near the poles.

## Node could not resolve the module graph

**Problem.** `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on every import.

* ~~Use the TypeScript convention of importing `./foo.js` for `./foo.ts`.~~
  **Every import failed.** That convention exists for `tsc`'s NodeNext *emit*,
  where the file really will be `.js` by the time anything runs. Node's native
  type stripping does not compile anything, so there is no `.js` and no
  rewriting step — imports have to name the file that actually exists.

* **Import `./foo.ts` directly, with `allowImportingTsExtensions` and
  `noEmit`.** Worked, and paid off twice: the dev server can then strip types
  on the way to the browser and serve the same files, so there is no build step
  anywhere in the project.

## Dynamic import of the suites failed on Windows

* ~~`await import(join(here, file))`.~~ **`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`,
  protocol `c:`.** An absolute Windows path starts with a drive letter, and the
  ESM loader reads `c:` as a URL scheme. Use `pathToFileURL(...).href`.

## Heredocs kept truncating source files

Not a code problem, but it cost time twice and is worth recording. Writing
these files through shell heredocs failed on punctuation-dense TypeScript —
bash reported an unexpected EOF and wrote nothing. Use the file-writing tools
for source, and reserve heredocs for short config and markdown.
